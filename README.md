# DOM-Manupulation-Example

In this repository I have added source code to show the basic use of DOM manupulation

I made a list in which you can add new items or delete existing items

This is to show a basic idea on how DOM(Document Object Model) works.

Checkout the working link on how it works: https://dodoshrey.github.io/DOM-Manupulation-Example
